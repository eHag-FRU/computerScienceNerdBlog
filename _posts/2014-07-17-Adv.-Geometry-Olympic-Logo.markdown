description: This project was made for high school advanced geometry. The original project asked for the student to draw an Olympic logo for a country they choose and to include different geometric aspects (tangents on a circle, different angles, etc.) I chose to do Japan, and asked the teacher if I could make a program to draw my logo instead of doing it by hand. This was done in Python with the Turtle library. At this point, I had not has any experience with object oriented programing. The code is messy, but I wanted to leave it in its original state.
