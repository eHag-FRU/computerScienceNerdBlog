description: The portfolio that is being viewed currently is one of my projects! This was a project for WEBD-101 at Franklin University during the Spring 2021 semester. This page was made from the ground level up, with HMTL, CSS, and a small bit of JavaScript and jQuery. One week at a time, the project was built upon, which was finished by the last day of class (4/17/2021). Professor Waicheong Jefferylam helped answer questions when I wanted to tweak or change aspects of the pages that moved away from the requirements. The occasional moving away from the requirements was due to the purpose of the sites creation and use. An example of this is the requirement to have one (1) CSS file, but multiple CSS files were permitted due to it fitting the purpose of the site better.
